## Color Science
- Filmic roll-off with soft contrast
- Rec.709 color space
- Plan 3% film grain in post-production

## White Balance
- 5600K for outdoor scenes (golden hour)
- 4300-4800K for office/corporate environments (cool)
- 4200K for clinical/medical scenes (green hint)

## Lenses
- 35mm for intimacy and emotional close-ups
- 50mm for office close-ups and detail work
- 24mm for stadium wide shots and drone footage
- 85mm for portrait work (especially SEG-08)

## Camera Motion
- Subtle, controlled movements throughout
- Drone movements: 0.5-1.0 m/s for descents
- No whip pans or jarring transitions
- Handheld should be stabilized (gimbal)
- Push-ins ≤0.2 m/s indoors

## Exposure
- Skin tones: 55-65 IRE
- Protect highlights across all segments
- Consistent mid-tone placement

## Grade
- One LUT applied across all segments for consistency
- No sudden hue shifts between segments
- Maintain emotional continuity through color

## Safety/IP
- No real logos, badges, or seals
- Generic venues and signage only if needed
- No on-frame legal text or watermarks
- Anonymize all minors (no identifiable faces)
- No real brand names or trademarks

## Render Specifications
- 24 fps constant throughout
- Avoid interpolation artifacts
- High bitrate MP4 export
- No embedded captions (text overlays in post)

## Conditioning & Aspect Policy
- Every Veo request must include a `referenceImage` from Imagen to enforce consistent grade, wardrobe, props, lens feel
- Primary aspect ratio is 16:9. Also render 9:16 and 1:1 alternates for social distribution, not cropped later
- Veo audio generation is disabled. We never accept model-generated dialogue, chanting, speech, or narration. All final sound is added in edit

## Audio Philosophy
- This film uses no narrator, no interview audio, no spoken VO
- Emotional load is delivered through:
  - on-screen text overlays in post
  - visual storytelling
  - musical score (Lyria)
  - optional abstract ambience bed (wind, room tone, stadium air, fluorescent hum) mixed later
- Human voices are intentionally absent. The silence is part of the tone
