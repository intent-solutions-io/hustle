Create a 60-second orchestral masterpiece that takes the listener on a devastating emotional journey:

**Movement 1: PURE INNOCENCE (0-10 seconds)**
- Playful, joyful orchestration
- Pizzicato strings, woodwinds (flutes, clarinets), harp glissandos
- Bright major key (G major)
- Childlike wonder, bubbling youthful energy
- Think Pixar's 'Up' opening - pure unbridled joy
- Tempo: Allegro (quick, happy)
- Dynamics: mf (moderately loud, bright)

**Movement 2: INSTITUTIONAL COLDNESS (10-22 seconds)**
- Transition to darker, corporate tones
- Low strings (cellos, double bass), minimal cold brass
- Shift to minor key (E minor)
- Disconnected, removed from humanity
- 'The Social Network' score aesthetic - cold calculation
- Tempo: Andante (walking pace, methodical)
- Dynamics: mf to f (building corporate weight)

**Movement 3: THE MONEY (22-37 seconds)**
- Adding tension and greed
- Dissonant piano notes, sharp violin stabs
- Dollar signs in musical form - repetitive, mechanical
- Building intensity, uncomfortable accumulation
- Think 'There Will Be Blood' score - greed and compromise
- Tempo: Moderato (steady, relentless)
- Dynamics: f to ff (loud, oppressive)

**Movement 4: CLINICAL HORROR (37-45 seconds)**
- Deeply unsettling, dissonant sustained notes
- High tension strings, atonal moments
- Suspended unresolved chords
- Medical thriller atmosphere - dehumanizing
- 'Requiem for a Dream' intensity
- Tempo: Adagio (slow, heavy)
- Dynamics: ff (very loud), sharp dynamic drops

**Movement 5: CONFUSION & HEARTBREAK (45-52 seconds)**
- Return of innocent themes but now broken, fractured
- Solo violin playing the childhood melody but in minor key, struggling
- Piano entering with melancholic supporting chords
- Recognition of loss, innocence shattered
- Tempo: Andante (slower, wounded)
- Dynamics: mf diminishing to mp (fading hope)

**Movement 6: THE UNANSWERED QUESTION (52-60 seconds)**
- Devastating emotional crescendo
- Full orchestra swelling to heartbreaking climax
- Solo violin soaring over orchestral bed with the question melody
- Major key attempting to emerge but can't fully resolve (A minor to C major suspended)
- Building to massive orchestral question mark
- Ethereal female soprano vocal enters: wordless "why?" - pure vocalization of pain and confusion
- Final chord: completely unresolved suspension, lingering in silence
- Think Hans Zimmer 'Interstellar' docking scene - emotional devastation
- Tempo: Ritardando (gradually slowing) into Adagio
- Dynamics: Building from mp to fff (extremely loud) then sudden drop to pp (whisper) on final unresolved note

**Overall Composition Style:**
- Live symphony orchestra recording (NOT synthesized)
- Natural concert hall reverb
- Emotional storytelling through leitmotifs:
  - Innocence theme (major, light, playful)
  - Money/Power theme (minor, heavy, mechanical)
  - Question theme (suspended, unresolved, aching)
- Award-winning prestige film score quality
- Think: Thomas Newman + Alexandre Desplat + Hans Zimmer + Jóhann Jóhannsson

**Full Instrumentation:**
- Strings: Full section (1st violin, 2nd violin, viola, cello, double bass)
- Woodwinds: Flute, clarinet, oboe, bassoon
- Brass: French horn (minimal use - only in power sections), trumpet (single note in climax)
- Keyboards: Piano (prominent in money/clinical sections), Harp (innocence only)
- Vocals: Female soprano (final 8 seconds only - wordless, devastating)
- Percussion: Minimal - triangle (innocence), soft timpani (institutional), suspended cymbal (clinical)

**Emotional Arc:**
Childhood Joy → Corporate Coldness → Greed & Compromise → Medical Horror → Shattered Dreams → Devastating Unanswered Question

The music should make people CRY. It should be unbearable by the end.
