Create 60-second orchestral masterpiece for documentary "Why Won't They Answer?" about women's sports. Divided into 8 movements matching video segments:

**Movement 1: INNOCENCE (0-8s)**
Joyful playful major key (G major), pizzicato strings, flutes, harp, childlike wonder - Allegro, mf dynamics. Young girls playing soccer with pure joy and passion.

**Movement 2: COMMISSIONER (8-16s)**
Transition to cold minor (E minor), low cellos/bass, institutional coldness - Andante, mf to f. Empty corporate office, power without accountability.

**Movement 3: KANG MONEY (16-24s)**
Building tension, dissonant piano notes entering, corporate calculation - Moderato, f dynamics. $30 million investment questioning.

**Movement 4: LONG STADIUM (24-32s)**
Money theme intensifies, mechanical repetition, sharp violin stabs - Moderato, f to ff. $117 million stadium built for women.

**Movement 5: WILF GREED (32-40s)**
Greed theme peaks, dissonant and uncomfortable, oppressive - Moderato, ff dynamics. Wealth and profit over principles.

**Movement 6: MEDICAL POLICY (40-48s)**
Atonal horror, sustained dissonant strings, clinical terror - Adagio, ff with sharp drops. Medical interventions as policy.

**Movement 7: CONFUSION (48-56s)**
Childhood theme returns fractured in minor key, solo violin struggling, melancholic - Andante, mf to mp fading. Young girls asking why.

**Movement 8: UNANSWERED (56-60s - 4 SECONDS)**
DEVASTATING crescendo, full orchestra swelling, soprano vocal wordless "why?", unresolved suspended chord lingering - Ritardando to Adagio, mp building to fff then dropping to pp whisper. Final question: "Why won't you answer them?"

**Overall Composition Style:**
- Live symphony orchestra recording (NOT synthesized)
- Natural concert hall reverb
- Emotional storytelling through leitmotifs:
  - Innocence theme (major, light, playful)
  - Money/Power theme (minor, heavy, mechanical)
  - Question theme (suspended, unresolved, aching)
- Award-winning prestige film score quality
- Think: Thomas Newman + Alexandre Desplat + Hans Zimmer + Jóhann Jóhannsson

**Full Instrumentation:**
- Strings: Full section (1st violin, 2nd violin, viola, cello, double bass)
- Woodwinds: Flute, clarinet, oboe, bassoon
- Brass: French horn (minimal use - only in power sections), trumpet (single note in climax)
- Keyboards: Piano (prominent in money/clinical sections), Harp (innocence only)
- Vocals: Female soprano (final 8 seconds only - wordless, devastating)
- Percussion: Minimal - triangle (innocence), soft timpani (institutional), suspended cymbal (clinical)

**Emotional Arc:**
Childhood Joy → Corporate Coldness → Greed & Compromise → Medical Horror → Shattered Dreams → Devastating Unanswered Question

The music should make people CRY. It should be unbearable by the end.
