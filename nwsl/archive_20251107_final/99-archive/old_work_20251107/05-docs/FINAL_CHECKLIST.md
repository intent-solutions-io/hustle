## 🔴 **BIGGEST PROBLEMS:**

1. **VIDEO IS 56 SECONDS NOT 60** - Missing final 4-second segment
2. **WRONG VISUAL CONTENT** - Using generic clips not specific scenes
3. **SEGMENT 8 NOT GENERATED** - The emotional climax is missing

---

## ✅ **WHAT'S WORKING:**

- Text overlay timing is correct
- Michele Kang $30M now fixed
- Watermark and hashtag present
- Video quality is good

---

## 🎯 **QUICK FIX PRIORITY:**

1. **Generate Segment 8** (4-second face with tear)
2. **Run fixed text overlay script** (now processing)
3. **Merge all 8 segments** for 60 seconds total
