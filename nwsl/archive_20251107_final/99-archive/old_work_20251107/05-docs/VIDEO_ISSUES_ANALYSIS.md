- **MISSING:** Segment 8 - "The Unanswered Question" (56-60s) - The emotional close-up face with tear

### 2. **MICHELE KANG $30 MILLION ERROR**
- **EXPECTED:** "Spent $30 million+ on women's soccer"
- **ACTUAL:** Shows "$0M" in overlay script (typo in the script)

## 🎬 **VISUAL CONTENT MISMATCH:**

The clips we generated don't match your prompt visuals:
- **Generated:** opening, ball, locker, cleats, field, tunnel, lights
- **Should be:** girls playing, executive office, investment/money, stadium aerial, luxury/wealth, medical clinic, confused girls, emotional face

## 🔧 **FIXES NEEDED:**

### IMMEDIATE:
1. **Generate 8th segment** - 4-second emotional close-up face
2. **Fix Michele Kang text** - Change $0M to $30 million+
3. **Add missing final text** - "Why won't you answer them?" at 57s

### OPTIONAL (for perfection):
4. Generate proper visual segments matching your descriptions
5. Ensure timing matches exactly (60s not 56s)
6. Add Lyria orchestral score with 8 movements

## 📊 **SUMMARY:**
- **Duration:** 56s instead of 60s
- **Segments:** 7 instead of 8
- **Text errors:** $0M instead of $30M
- **Missing:** Final emotional segment
- **Visual mismatch:** Generic clips vs specific scenes requested
