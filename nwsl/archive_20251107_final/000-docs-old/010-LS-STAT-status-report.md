## LEARNINGS FROM TEST

### What Went WRONG:
1. **Message was confused** - Called controversy "manufactured" when it's JUSTIFIED
2. **Not thinking like filmmaker** - Focused on tech, not storytelling
3. **Missing emotional arc** - No professional audio, color grading plan
4. **No prestige feel** - Just stitched clips, not a documentary trailer

### What Went RIGHT:
1. **Infrastructure works** - Veo API, Cloud Storage, Cloud Run all operational
2. **Video quality looks good** - 6MB, 2.7MB, 5.3MB file sizes indicate quality
3. **Fast generation** - 3 clips in ~5 minutes
4. **Cost-effective** - $18 for 3 clips ($6 each)

## NEXT: PRESTIGE VERSION with CORRECTED MESSAGE

### Core Message (CORRECTED):
**"NWSL policy allows biological males to compete in women's league. Elizabeth Eddy spoke truth. She was silenced. Defend women's sports."**

### The Real Story:
- ✅ NWSL policy DOES allow trans women (testosterone <10 nmol/L)
- ✅ This is a WOMEN'S league - policy betrays women
- ✅ Zero have competed YET - but **THE DOOR IS OPEN**
- ✅ Elizabeth Eddy was RIGHT to demand stricter rules
- ✅ Teammates calling her "racist/transphobic" is the REAL manufactured controversy
