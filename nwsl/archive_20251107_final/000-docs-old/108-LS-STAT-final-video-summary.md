## 📊 Technical Implementation

### Smart Clip Strategy
Instead of generating a single 60-second video (which would cost $45-68), we generated 7 shorter clips and merged them:
- **Cost:** ~$21-28 (60% savings)
- **Quality:** Maintained photorealistic documentary style
- **Flexibility:** Allowed for better narrative control

### Segment Mapping
Created `SEGMENT_MAPPING_STRATEGY.md` explaining how 37 seconds of raw footage extends to 56 seconds through:
- Speed ramping (slow motion on emotional moments)
- Clip reuse (opening stadium used 3x at different speeds)
- Crossfade transitions (0.5s between segments)
- Strategic holds on powerful moments

1. **Pure Innocence** (0-10s) - Playful, joyful, G major
2. **Institutional Coldness** (10-22s) - Corporate, E minor
3. **The Money** (22-37s) - Dissonant, mechanical
4. **Clinical Horror** (37-45s) - Atonal, unsettling

6. **The Unanswered Question** (52-60s) - Unresolved suspension, soprano vocal

**Note:** Lyria audio generation pending - script prepared for when audio is available

Why won't they answer?

Commissioner Berman. Michele Kang ($30M invested). Angie Long ($117M stadium). The Wilf Family.

60 days of silence while the 2021 NWSL Policy remains in place.

Thousands of young girls deserve answers.
