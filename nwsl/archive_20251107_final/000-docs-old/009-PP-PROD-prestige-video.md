# NWSL Documentary Trailer - Prestige Version
**Master Cinematic Prompt for World-Class Video**

---

## Executive Vision

**This isn't a social media clip. This is a 32-second documentary trailer that changes the conversation about women's sports.**

Think: **HBO Sports, ESPN 30 for 30, Netflix documentary opening.**

---

## The 4-Act Structure

### ACT 1: THE DREAM (0-8 seconds)
**Visual Concept:**
```
4K ultra-cinematic slow-motion. Professional women's soccer championship match at peak moment.
Female athletes in mid-celebration after scoring winning goal. Faces filled with pure joy,
tears streaming, teammates embracing. Golden hour stadium lighting creates ethereal glow.
Camera captures intimate emotional moment - the WHY they play. Diverse team, powerful athletic
builds, genuine human connection. Shot on Arri Alexa, shallow depth of field isolates emotion.
Documentary realism meets artistic beauty. This is women's sports at its absolute finest.
Colors: Warm golds, deep greens, emotional authenticity. Professional sports cinematography,
National Geographic/ESPN quality. 8 seconds.
```

**Lyria Audio:** Inspirational orchestral rise, emotional strings, hope building

**Emotional Beat:** "This is what we're protecting"

---

### ACT 2: THE DOCUMENT (8-16 seconds)
**Visual Concept:**
```
Cinematic transition to documentary investigation mode. Extreme close-up 4K of official
NWSL transgender policy document dated March 2021. Camera slowly pushes in with precision,
revealing key text about testosterone levels (10 nmol/L). Film noir lighting through venetian
blinds creates dramatic shadows across the page. Legal document aesthetic - serious, official,
governmental. As camera zooms, the document becomes an ominous presence. High contrast black
and white cinematography. Think "All the President's Men" meets "Spotlight" - investigative
journalism tension. Paper texture visible, official stamps clear. The policy that started
everything. 8 seconds.
```

**Lyria Audio:** Music shifts - ominous low tones, tension building, subtle heartbeat percussion

**Emotional Beat:** "Then there's the policy..."

---

### ACT 3: THE SILENCING (16-24 seconds)
**Visual Concept:**
```
4K dramatic metaphor. Empty professional women's locker room after hours. Single soccer jersey
with number "1" hanging alone under harsh spotlight, all other jerseys removed from hooks.
Slow 360-degree camera orbit around the isolated jersey creating sense of abandonment. Modern
athletic facility, pristine but cold. Shadows dominate the frame. The jersey sways slightly
as if breathing. Metaphor for: one voice standing alone, being singled out, cancelled for
speaking truth. Emotional weight of isolation palpable. Film technique: use negative space to
create loneliness. Color palette shifts to cooler tones - blues, greys. Cinematic composition
worthy of a Fincher film. This is what happens when you speak up. 8 seconds.
```

**Lyria Audio:** Emotional strings, somber piano notes, feeling of loss and isolation

**Emotional Beat:** "One voice. Silenced for speaking truth."

---

### ACT 4: THE VOID (24-32 seconds)
**Visual Concept:**
```
4K aerial cinematography masterpiece. Ultra-wide drone shot starting from 500 feet above empty
professional women's soccer stadium at dusk. Golden hour magic - long shadows cast across
pristine grass, stadium seats completely empty, no players, no controversy, absolute silence.
Slow cinematic descent toward center field, camera movement deliberate and meaningful. The
field where it all began. Beautiful but haunting. As we descend, the emptiness becomes more
apparent - this massive controversy was about... nothing. No transgender players. No actual
threat. Just manufactured outrage. Stadium lights off, scoreboard dark. The void where reason
should be. Final shot: freeze on empty goal, hold for 2 seconds. Fade to black.

Watermark appears in final 2 seconds: '@asphaltcowb0y' in white text with subtle black outline,
bottom right corner, professional motion graphics style.

Cinematography: National Geographic / BBC Earth quality aerial work. 8 seconds.
```

**Lyria Audio:** Music fades to single sustained note, then silence. Power in the void.

**Emotional Beat:** "All this... for nothing."

## Cost Analysis

### Option A: Current Approach (Merge 4 Clips)
- 4 Veo clips × $6 = **$24**
- Cloud merge + Lyria = **Free tier**
- **Total: $24**
- **Quality:** Good, but visible seams between clips

### Option B: Single Long Video (If Possible)
- Research longer video generation APIs
- Runway Gen-3: $0.05/sec × 32s = **$1.60** (way cheaper!)
- Pika: Similar pricing
- **But:** Need to test if they handle 32s

### Option C: Professional Edit (Recommended for Prestige)
- Generate 4 perfect clips: **$24**
- Hire video editor on Fiverr: **$50-100**
- Professional Lyria score: **$0.12** (60s audio)
- **Total: ~$80**
- **Quality:** PRESTIGE. Changes the game.

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Current Video** (3 of 4 clips done, waiting for scene3)
2. **Test Current Merge** (see if auto-merge works well enough)
3. **If Quality Issues:** Hire professional editor for $50-100
4. **If Quality Good:** Generate 5 more variations for different angles
5. **Platform Strategy:** X first, then LinkedIn (different caption)

- **Forcing honest conversations** about policy vs reality
