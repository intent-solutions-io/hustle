## ACT 1: THE FOUNDATION (Clips 1-10)
**Theme:** Women's sports fought for equality and won

### **Clip 1: The Empty Stadium**
**Duration:** 2 seconds
**Narrative Purpose:** Shows how women's sports were once ignored, setting up the triumph to come.

```
(Cinematic, 16:9, 1080p, melancholic documentary realism)

Scene: An overhead wide shot of an empty 1970s women's soccer stadium at dusk, with rusted bleachers, overgrown grass on the edges, and a single flickering floodlight casting long shadows across the field.

Action: The camera slowly reveals the emptiness—no players, no crowd, just abandoned goal posts and a worn-out ball sitting motionless at midfield.

Camera: Start as an extreme wide aerial shot, slowly descending and pushing in toward the lone soccer ball at center field, ending on a medium shot of the ball with the empty stands blurred in the background.

Ambiance & Audio: Melancholic and haunting. The only sounds are distant wind whistling through empty bleachers, the faint creak of metal stands, and a lone bird call. No music, just the sound of abandonment.

Negative Prompt: no people, no modern stadium features, no bright colors, no dialogue, no jump cuts.
```

**Narrative Purpose:** Shows the legal foundation that made women's sports possible.

```
(Cinematic, 16:9, 1080p, news broadcast style)

Scene: A 1972-style government office with wood paneling, an official desk with an American flag in the background, and a formal document being signed with a fountain pen.

Action: A close-up of a woman's hand signing "Title IX" on an official document, the pen moving deliberately across the paper, ink glistening as it dries.

Camera: Start on an extreme close-up of the pen tip touching paper, slowly pull back to reveal the hand signing, then tilt up slightly to show the Title IX text on the document heading.

Ambiance & Audio: Quiet and ceremonial. The scratch of pen on paper, the rustling of the document, distant camera shutters clicking, and a subtle hopeful orchestral swell.

Negative Prompt: no dialogue, no modern technology, no casual clothing, no bright lighting, no digital screens.

```
(Cinematic, 16:9, 1080p, noir/shadow with tension)

Scene: Pre-game locker room, female athletes sitting in their stalls, one player (our subject, face obscured) at far end isolated, three teammates in foreground whispering to each other and glancing back at her with cold expressions.
