## EXAMPLE (Clip 1):

**Clip 1: The Empty Stadium**
**Duration:** 2 seconds
**Narrative Purpose:** Shows how women's sports were once ignored, setting up the triumph to come.

```
(Cinematic, 16:9, 1080p, melancholic documentary realism)

Scene: An overhead wide shot of an empty 1970s women's soccer stadium at dusk, with rusted bleachers, overgrown grass on the edges, and a single flickering floodlight casting long shadows across the field.

Action: The camera slowly reveals the emptiness—no players, no crowd, just abandoned goal posts and a worn-out ball sitting motionless at midfield.

Camera: Start as an extreme wide aerial shot, slowly descending and pushing in toward the lone soccer ball at center field, ending on a medium shot of the ball with the empty stands blurred in the background.

Ambiance & Audio: Melancholic and haunting. The only sounds are distant wind whistling through empty bleachers, the faint creak of metal stands, and a lone bird call. No music, just the sound of abandonment.

Negative Prompt: no people, no modern stadium features, no bright colors, no dialogue, no jump cuts.
