   - Technical term: Gonadectomy/orchiectomy
   - Decision: Use plain language for public understanding
   - Maintains accuracy while improving clarity

2. **Exact Thresholds**
   - Kept precise: "<10 nmol/L" and "≥12 months"
   - No simplification of technical requirements
   - Ensures factual accuracy

3. **Policy Title**
   - Used official: "NWSL Policy on Transgender Athletes"
   - Removed: "& Non-Binary" (not in official title)
   - Matches 2021 policy document exactly
