Color grading: Warm twilight tones, desaturated greens, rich orange-purple sky gradient. Cinematic color science (ARRI Alexa look).

Style: Cinematic landscape, twilight photography, emotional documentary shot.
```

Cinematography: Tight close-up (CU) on face, shallow depth of field (f/2.8), twilight natural key light from camera left, soft fill from right. Athlete stands still, maintains eye contact with camera. Slight head tilt suggesting questioning posture.

Wardrobe: Clean soccer jersey (purple or red), hair pulled back in ponytail, minimal makeup, natural athlete appearance.

Lighting: Twilight golden hour, soft directional light creating gentle shadows, warm skin tones, professional portrait lighting setup.
