**Date:** 2025-11-07
**Phase:** 2A - Policy Overlay Swap
**Purpose:** Factual accuracy verification for text overlays

## Segment 2 - Governance Overlays

### Updated Overlays
1. "Jessica Berman — NWSL Commissioner (since 2022)."
2. "The league's Board of Governors (club ownership representatives) controls major decisions."

### Governance Source
- **Board of Governors:** The NWSL Board of Governors consists of club ownership representatives who control major league decisions including policy changes
- **Commissioner:** Jessica Berman appointed as NWSL Commissioner in April 2022, taking office May 2022

## Segment 6 - Policy Overlays

### Updated Overlays
1. "NWSL Policy on Transgender Athletes (2021)."
2. "Eligibility for transgender women: declare female identity and keep serum testosterone <10 nmol/L for ≥12 months; compliance is tested."
3. "Suppression can be via medication or surgical castration."

### Policy Source
**NWSL Policy on Transgender Athletes (March 31, 2021)**
- **Testosterone Requirement:** Serum testosterone must be maintained below 10 nmol/L for at least 12 continuous months
- **Suppression Methods:** Can be achieved through androgen suppression medication or gonadectomy (surgical removal of gonads)
- **Plain Language Note:** We use "surgical castration" in overlays for clarity - this refers to gonadectomy/orchiectomy as stated in the official policy
- **Compliance Testing:** Policy requires ongoing compliance monitoring through testing

---

## Terminology Adjustments

### "Non-Binary" Removal
- **Original References:** Policy title sometimes referenced as "Transgender & Non-Binary Policy"
- **Corrected To:** "NWSL Policy on Transgender Athletes" (official 2021 title)
- **Rationale:** The official policy document from March 31, 2021 is titled "NWSL Policy on Transgender Athletes" without "Non-Binary" in the title
- **Files Checked:** All docs/ files searched - no "non-binary" references found in segment overlays

## Notes on Language Choices

1. **"Surgical castration"**: Used instead of technical term "gonadectomy" for plain language clarity in public-facing overlays
2. **"<10 nmol/L"**: Exact threshold from policy document maintained for accuracy
3. **"≥12 months"**: Duration requirement stated exactly as in policy
4. **"compliance is tested"**: Simplified from policy's detailed testing requirements
