# EDL Overview - "Why Won't They Answer?"

## Documentary Structure

This 60-second documentary unfolds through 8 precisely timed segments that create an emotional journey from innocence through institutional power to devastating questioning. The narrative arc moves from the pure joy of youth soccer through the cold machinery of corporate sports governance, exposing the NWSL transgender policy's impact on young female athletes.

The edit begins with SEG-01 (docs/004-DR-REFF-veo-seg-01.md), establishing childhood innocence and athletic joy in golden hour warmth. This transitions sharply to SEG-02 (docs/005-DR-REFF-veo-seg-02.md), the cold institutional power of an empty commissioner's office. Segments 3-5 (docs/006-DR-REFF-veo-seg-03.md through docs/008-DR-REFF-veo-seg-05.md) expose the financial machinery - Michele Kang's $30 million investment, Angie Long's $117 million stadium, and the Wilfs' wealth calculations. SEG-06 (docs/009-DR-REFF-veo-seg-06.md) delivers the clinical horror of the medical policy reality. SEG-07 (docs/010-DR-REFF-veo-seg-07.md) returns to the youth players, now confused and hurt at dusk. The final SEG-08 (docs/011-DR-REFF-veo-seg-08.md), at only 4 seconds, delivers the devastating emotional climax - a single tear and an unanswered question.
