# Terraform Production Environment Configuration

This directory is intentionally empty and reserved for future Terraform configuration files specific to the production environment.

When terraform configurations are added, this directory will contain:
- Environment-specific variables (`terraform.tfvars`)
- State backend configuration
- Provider overrides for production
- Production-specific resource configurations (with stricter policies)

Do not remove this directory.
