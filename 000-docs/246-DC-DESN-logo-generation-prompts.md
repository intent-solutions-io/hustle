## Hustle Logo - Full Wordmark + Icon

### Primary Prompt (Recommended)

```
Professional sports technology logo for "HUSTLE" - a youth soccer statistics platform.

Design style: Modern, minimal, tech-forward with athletic energy. Clean geometric shapes with subtle motion implied.

Visual elements:
- Soccer ball incorporated into letterform (subtly integrated, not literal)
- Forward momentum or upward trajectory suggesting performance growth
- Data visualization element (small graph line, metric point, or verification checkmark)
- Sharp, confident typography with slight forward lean
- Color palette: Zinc/charcoal (#18181b) primary, electric blue (#4285F4) accent for tech credibility

Mood: Professional yet energetic. Trusted by recruiters, built for competitive athletes. Balances athletic performance with data credibility.

Logo lockup: Wordmark "HUSTLE" with integrated icon that works standalone. Should work in monochrome and full color.

Reference aesthetic: Modern sports tech (Strava, Whoop, Stats Perform) meets Google Cloud product design. Not playful youth sports - this is serious performance tracking.

Tagline context (for design alignment): "Performance data recruiters trust"

Output: Clean vector-ready design, transparent background, suitable for GitHub repository header, website favicon, and mobile app icon.
```

Icon concept: Abstract "H" letterform integrated with:
- Upward-trending graph line showing performance growth

Style: Geometric, modern, single-color adaptable. Think Firebase logo meets athletic performance.

Color: Zinc/charcoal (#18181b) with optional electric blue (#4285F4) accent.

Constraint: Must work at 16x16px (favicon), 512x512px (app icon), and scale infinitely (SVG).
