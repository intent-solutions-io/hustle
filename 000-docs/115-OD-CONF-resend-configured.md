## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Issue: No email received

### Issue: "Email service not configured"

**Cause:** Environment variables not loaded
**Fix:** Restart dev server (`npm run dev`)

### Issue: "Invalid API key"

**Cause:** Wrong key or typo
**Fix:** Verify key in .env.local matches Resend dashboard

### Issue: Emails going to spam

**Solution 1:** Mark as "Not Spam" in your email client
**Solution 2:** Verify domain in Resend (production)
**Solution 3:** Warm up domain (send 10-20/day first week)
